DYN is a map generator written in javascript. 

It's not the most well written or thought-out code ever, but there are some interesting problems and solutions in there somewhere. Unfortunately this was one of the first web projects I started, so the quality of the code can be absolutely dreadful in places. Several years and other projects later it is now shaping up to be a rather nice map generator, and hopefully will continue to be as I add more and more features.

Features:
	Procedurally generated: Lakes, Mountains, Forests, Rivers, Sand
	Intelligently placed: Cities, Roads, Cultures
	Dynamically developed: History, and populations

Planned: 
	AI driven people
	Factories and markets
	Conflicts and warfare
	Religion and great people
	Dynasties
	Player control

Use:
	Note: This map generator is still very much in development, and will crash/bug out.

	Please consider using Chrome.
	Go to fpalm.se/map
	Press "Dynasty". 
	Wait for the map to be generated. This shouldn't take more than a minute
	If it crashes, try resizing the window and trying again.
	Press "start" to start the "game". Altenatively you can press "New Game With Options" to generate another world.

	Once running the "game", you can do the following:
		Use mouse wheel to zoom in or out. 
		Use keyboard to move around the map.
		Press tiles or cities for more info.
